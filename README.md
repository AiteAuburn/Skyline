# Skyline
This is the final project of the Distributed and Parallel Systems: Paradigms and Models course. In this repository, there is the parallel implementation of the skyline algorithm, in two versions: by using the standard C++17 programming language and by writing in standard C++17 but leaning also on the FastFlow library.
